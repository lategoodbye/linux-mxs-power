menuconfig ARC_PLAT_EZNPS

	help
	  Support for EZchip development platforms,
	  based on ARC700 cores.
	  We handle few flavors:
	    - Hardware Emulator AKA HE which is FPGA based chassis
	    - Simulator based on MetaWare nSIM
	    - NPS400 chip based on ASIC

config EZNPS_MTM_EXT
	bool "ARC-EZchip MTM Extensions"
	select CPUMASK_OFFSTACK
	depends on ARC_PLAT_EZNPS && SMP
	default y
	help
	  Here we add new hierarchy for CPUs topology.
	  We got:
		Core
		Thread
	  At the new thread level each CPU represent one HW thread.
	  At highest hierarchy each core contain 16 threads,
	  any of them seem like CPU from Linux point of view.
	  All threads within same core share the execution unit of the
	  core and HW scheduler round robin between them.

config EZNPS_MEM_ERROR
       bool "ARC-EZchip Memory error as an exception"
       depends on ARC_PLAT_EZNPS
       default n
       help
	  Enable this for NPS Silicon (not simulator)
	  On the real chip of the NPS, user memory errors are handled
	  as a machine check exception, whereas on simulator platform
	  for NPS, it handled as an interrupt level 2 (like legacy arc
	  real chip architecture).This configuration will cause the kernel
	  to handle memory error as a machine check exception.
