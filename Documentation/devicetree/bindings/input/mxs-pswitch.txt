* Freescale i.MX23/i.MX28 power switch device tree bindings

The Freescale MXS SoC has a pswitch pin which has several power related
functions determined by a product's hardware and software design.

The pswitch input driver allow for the user space handling of power events.

Required properties:
- compatible:
  - "fsl,imx23-pswitch" for i.MX23
  - "fsl,imx28-pswitch" for i.MX28
- interrupts: The pswitch interrupt number.
- linux,code: The linux key code the event maps to.

Example for i.MX28:

	power: power@80044000 {
		compatible = "fsl,imx28-power", "syscon";
		reg = <0x80044000 0x2000>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		pswitch: pswitch@5 {
			compatible = "fsl,imx28-pswitch";
			reg = <0x5>;
			linux,code = <116>;
			interrupts = <6>;
		};
	};
