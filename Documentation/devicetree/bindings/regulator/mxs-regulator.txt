Regulators for Freescale i.MX23/i.MX28

Required properties:
For imx23 regulators
- compatible:
  - "fsl,imx23-vddd" for VDDD
  - "fsl,imx23-vdda" for VDDA
  - "fsl,imx23-vddio" for VDDIO
For imx28 regulators
- compatible:
  - "fsl,imx28-vddd" for VDDD
  - "fsl,imx28-vdda" for VDDA
  - "fsl,imx28-vddio" for VDDIO
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device. It contains
  the information of registers in the same order as described by reg-names
- reg-names: Should contain the reg names
  - "base-address"	- contains base address of regulator
  - "v5ctrl-address"	- contains control address of DC-DC 5V convertor
  - "status-address"	- contains status address of regulator

Any regulator property defined as part of the core regulator
binding, defined in regulator.txt, can also be used.

Example for i.MX28:

	power: power@80044000 {
		compatible = "fsl,imx28-power";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0x80044000 0x2000>;
		interrupts = <6>;
		ranges;

		reg_vddd: regulator@80044040 {
			reg = <0x80044040 0x10>,
			      <0x80044010 0x10>,
			      <0x800440c0 0x10>;
			reg-names = "base-address",
				    "v5ctrl-address",
				    "status-address";
			compatible = "fsl,imx28-vddd";
			regulator-name = "vddd";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <1350000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <1550000>;
		};
	};
